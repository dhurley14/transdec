THIS IS NEW

## transdec
**transdec** is a file transfer system built on the ZeroTier SDN.

## Problem
Trying to transfer a file between two computers sucks.  curl, scp, ftp,
Airdrop, Dropbox, Google cloud, and best of all, emailing it to yourself.

For reference see this tweet..

I cannot do this without the cloud :(</p>&mdash; Peter van Dijk (@Habbie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Habbie/status/747014264368553984">June 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

It's *current year* why can't we just send a file between two networked
devices!  Well **transdec** solves this.  We provide a web interface to help you
manage connections between your networked devices.  You just select a device
to transfer a file to and boom you're done.  You just need the ZeroTier app
installed on your devices in order to join the network you create.  Hopefully
in the future this will be easier to setup but it's still really freaking easy
now.

We're gonna need a login portal to manage the devices as well as software to 
open up the necessary ports on each device.  So I guess users will need to
download extra software afterall..  W/e.
